What are components?
Interchangeable with Views. Collection of javascript functions that produce HTML.

JSX:
- cannot be interpretted by the browser
- webpack and babel translates jsx to javascript

Why bother with JSX?
- So javascript code that can produce html
- we can just use javascript but JSX is easier
JSX:
const App = function() { 
	return <div>Hi!</div>; 
}
Vanilla js ES5:
	retur React.createElement("div", null, "Hi!");

- imagine nesting...
